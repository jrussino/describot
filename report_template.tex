\section{DH-Parameters}\label{dh-parameters}
The following table lists the Denavit-Harternberg Parameters for this "CONFIG" serial robot manipulator:

\[
DHPARAM
\]

\section{Forward Kinematics}\label{forward kinematics}
The transformation matrix $ _0^NUMT $ describes the position and orientation of the end effector frame with respect to the base frame, as a function of the joint angles and link lengths:

\[
_0^NUMT =
TRANSMAT
\]

\section{Equations of Motion}\label{equations of motion}
The vector $ ^0v_NUM $ describes the translational velocity of the end effector with respect to the base frame, as a function of the joint velocities. 

\[
LINV
\]

The vector $ ^0w_NUM $ describes the rotational velocity of the end effector with respect to the base frame, as a function of the joint velocities. 

\[
ROTV
\]

\section{Jacobian}\label{Jacobian}
The matrix $ J $ is the Jacobian that relates joint velocities to end-effector velocity, as described in the frame of the end effector:

\[
J = 
JACOB
\]
